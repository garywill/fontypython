ROADMAP
=======

NOTE 1
In order to move ahead we need to stick to a single conceptual framework and 
I think the one to use is:
  "Make and show font items and fitmaps *only* in pages of X items."
This is a conservative approach. It assumes few resources are available to
run Fonty. It tries to prioritize speed of start-up and lightness of footprint.


wxgui Bugs
==========
Bug 1
Notebook focus bug:
1. Click Folder tab. 
2. Click a folder in DirCtrl. 
3. Click Pog Tab. Notice it takes 2 clicks to go there.
Best fix : Keep old notebook control and have it function properly. 
Next best: Replace with aui notebook.


wxgui Tasks
===========
A) Pager
If possible, replace the combo-box for paging with a more web-like 
pager control: << < 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 > >> 

B) Font view selection
Ctrl+a for select-all (visible in page)
shift+click for range selection


Mad Ideas
=========
PANOSE WIZARD
My understanding of Panose is very basic. I could not find proper info online. I read
what I could. 

Given that Panose is some kind of encoding of a Font's attributes and that
some of those are its appearance -- it should be possible to construct a Panose number
from a series of visuals. For example:
(picture of a serif letter)[radio button]
(picture of a sans letter)[radio button]
Next>>
(picture of a western letter)[radio button]
(picture of a non-western letter)[radio button]
Next>>
{Latin fork in road}
(picture of a curved serif)[radio button]
(picture of a block serif)[radio button]
Next>>
And so on... until the entire set of Panose choices has been run and we can present
a Panose number for them.

Could this be done? If so, it should happen in the panel above the search bar.
It should also have a history and a means to enter the wizard at arbitrary points of the 
chain. It should be obvious, easy and quick.
