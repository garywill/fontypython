FORMULA
=======
I have an "original" pot file in pofiles/fp_orig_ref.pot
This file has the header filled-in. Kind of. It stands as the
"memory" of the process. When I do a new xgettext the output
has default header info, so I use fp_orig_ref to merge that header
stuff back in again.

Don't damage or lose this file. (Well, I can always make a new one.)

See the Makefile for the actual steps.

When there are code changes: make a new pot file.
1. make
2. make update
3. loop to dev

When there is new translation work:
1. make
2. get the new stuff into the correct .po file in pofiles
   It may require a msgmerge off to the side.
3. make update

When you are ready for a release:
1. make
2. make update
3. make mos



DEMO
==

in testpo:
I made a short A.pot. Header only. Nothing past the initial:
# I changed this
# Copyright (C) 2017
# This file is distributed under the same license as the fptest package.
# Donn yadda
#
#, fuzzy
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: A 0.1\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2017-12-10 10:56+0200\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"
"Last-Translator: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>\n"
"Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>\n"
"Language: \n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CHARSET\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

Then I made B.pot from the source:
xgettext -o B.pot -L Python ../fontypythonmodules/strings.py

Then I merged A and B!
msgmerge A.pot B.pot -o B.pot
(The order is NB)

Now I have B.pot that carries the headers etc. Phew.

Now I can go merge the fr_FR.UTF-8.po file with B.pot
