TRANSLATION README
==================
Very rough guide.

1. Assume that the source is more recent than any po/pot file.
2. Use xgettext to make a fresh original: (go into the app root folder, two up from here.)

xgettext -o fp_all.pot -L Python fp -L Python fontypython fontypythonmodules/*.py

3. Copy fp_all.pot into fontypythonmodules/pofiles (you can erase the old one.)
4. Merge it with the other po files, one by one. For example, if you are handling French then merge fp_all.pot with fr_all.merged.po and output the new file as fp_all.merged.pot:

msgmerge fr_all.merged.po fp_all.pot -o fr_all.merged.pot

5. Make sure it worked (open it and check) and then delete *_all.merged.po (the old files)
While you are looking, fix the file header (compare to old file), make sure the charset variable is correct. Example:
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

6. Rename your new files to .po (Why this step is needed totally defeats me.)
7. Open (I like poedit) and edit the file.
8. Generate a .mo file - from poedit or:
msgfmt somepofile.po -o somemofile.mo

9. Move the .mo file into ../locales/fr/LC_MESSAGES/all.mo (erasing the old .mo file)
10. Send me your po and mo files !

Using the makefile
==================
May 2009
I wrote a makefile to help with translation. It lives in the root of the app.
1. make : Will build the fp_all.pot file. Please look for errors.
2. make renamepot : Will make the .po files in fontypythonmodules/pofiles. Go edit them.
3. make mos : Will make the .mo files and put them into the fontypythonmodules/locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/all.mo
   If you make a .mo with poedit (or some other app) then that's fine too. Don't run make mos.

To test:
========
LANG=langcode_LANGCODE.utf8
./fontypython
