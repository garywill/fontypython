FUTURE IDEAS
============
Turn the filter into a more google-like search bar. Have it search the fontInfo results: various fields, PANOSE numbers, Family, Style and Filename.

Have a PANOSE/VISUAL-FONT WIZARD near the search bar somewhere. Find fonts by style-cues like bold, fantasy, serif etc.

Have "font matching code" (Fontmatrix has it now!) for finding fonts close to a bitmap sample.

A font inspector - open a dialogue showing all the glyphs at each
character position. This has been asked for, but may not make it into 
Fonty soon.

The gradient in the font bitmaps

Distinguish TTC somehow
Perhaps - a small icon to show TTF vs Type1 vs TTC etc.

Don't forget to remove the wx debug stuff on the app object

SIMPLIFY THE HELP. Make the .fonts thing PRIMARY

Possible: A fade-to-white on right edge of fitmaps so long text doesn't look so cut-off.

A start-up initial directory for font source.
