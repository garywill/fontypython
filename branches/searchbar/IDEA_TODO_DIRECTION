=========
1. Turn the filter into a more google-like search bar. Have it search the fontInfo results: various fields, PANOSE numbers, Family, Style and Filename.
2. Have history of search -- preserve in pickle.
3. Have a slide-up panel to provide access to various search fields for help.
4. Have a PANOSE WIZARD near the search bar somewhere.

1. Abstracted the code in wxgui.py that deals with the filter text control. There is now a definite list held in fpsys.state.filteredViewObject that gets reset and filtered in the right places. (on click of new pog/folder and on presence of a string in filter control).
2. Added a new module 'fontyfilter' that should be used to do the actual search logic. It has a function 'doFilter' that gets the filter string -- parsing logic needs to be added here. pyparsing is a good idea.
