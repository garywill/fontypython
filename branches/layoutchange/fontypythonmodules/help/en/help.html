Use it to view, gather and manage fonts. You can install and uninstall fonts to your user fonts folder for temporary use in other apps.</em></p> <p><a href="#idea">The Idea</a> | <a href="#info">User Font Paths</a> | <a href="#layout">The Layout</a> | <a href="#menus">Menus</a> | <a href="#hushing">Hushing</a> | <a href="#shortcuts">Shortcuts</a> | <a href="#tips">Tips</a> | <a href="#l10n">Localization</a> | <a href="#bugs">Bugs</a> | <a href="#lic">Licence</a></p> <p><a name="idea"></a></p> <h1><font color="{heading1}">Ye Olde Basic Idea</font></h1> <p>You visually gather fonts into a "Pog", and then install it. All its fonts will be available to other apps. When you finish your work, uninstall the Pog.</p> <p>I pinched the word "Pog" from "ty<strong>pog</strong>raphy". It means "collection", "group", "bunch", "box", "case", "stack" or "pile" &mdash; you get the picture.</p> <p>Your fonts never move from where they live, neither are copies made; <em>only</em> links to the original files are used to install the fonts into your user fonts directory.</p> <p>For example, you might have a Pog called "Logos" into which you place all the fonts needed to design a logo. When you want to work, install the "Logos" Pog and start your design app. All those fonts will now appear in Inkscape, the Gimp, etc. When you're done, uninstall "Logos" and all those fonts go away. (The links to the original files are removed, <strong>not</strong> the actual font files!)</p> <p>Fonty is also great for just looking at fonts, wherever they are on your computer, without having to install them first. She also has a command line, allowing very quick use. You can install/uninstall Pogs without having to start the entire gui, which is neat.</p> <p>If you have any problems, please open a ticket: {TICKET_URL}</p> <p><a href="#top">Top</a> {SEP}</p> <p><a name="info"></a></p> <h1><font color="{heading1}">User Fonts Paths</font></h1> <h3><font color="{heading3}">Your fontypython directory</font></h3> <p>Where all your Pogs are kept. </p> <p>{FP_DIR}</p> <h3><font color="{heading3}">Your user fonts directory</font></h3> <p>{UF_DIR}</p> <p>If there's a dot in front (like .local) that means the directory is "hidden".

To work with <em>only</em> the fonts that you install via Fonty, hit Ctrl+H to <strong>hush</strong>. Your apps will now list <strong>only</strong> your desired fonts. (Until you un-hush.)</p> <p>Simply install Pogs via Fonty as normal and start a hush. In your other apps, you should see the difference. (For e.g. go into Inkscape and open the "Text &amp; Font" dialogue.)</p> <h4><font color="{heading4}">The "Hush Pog" and a mild Warning</font></h4> <p>As you can imagine, a hush could reject many crucial fonts...</p> <p>In order to make sure that your system has a few it can use, Fonty requires you to choose a Pog that is installed when hushing. Call it a "Hush Pog". </p> <p>Create a Pog of your own and put some typical system fonts into it. Good choices are: <strong>DejaVu, Sans, Serif, Mono, Free-, Liberation-, Ubuntu-</strong> and so forth. This depends on your locale and preferences, therefore we leave it to you.</p> <p>(These kinds of fonts are usually found in "/usr/share/fonts".)</p> <p>Fonty will ask for a Pog when you start a hush; select the one you prepared.</p> <p>It's not serious, but <strong>you have been warned.</strong></p> <h2><font color="{heading2}">Details</font></h2> <p>This all requires a working fontconfig setup, which most modern Linux distros have. Fonty looks for the directory:</p> <pre><code>{HOME}/.config/fontconfig/conf.d </code></pre> <p>If it's not found, you can't hush fonts. (If you have more information, please open a ticket.)</p> <p>Fonty writes a config file which instructs fontconfig to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Reject</strong> all files that start with "/usr/share/fonts"</li> <li><strong>Allow</strong> all fonts installed in the user fonts directory. </li> </ul> <p>The effect is usually instantaneous, but you may need to restart certain apps for them to notice. (If you find there are still fonts appearing that you do not want to see, please open a ticket.)</p> <h2><font color="{heading2}">Reversing a hush: the Un-hush</font></h2> <p>To switch all the system fonts on again, go into the hush screen where you can "Un-hush". </p> <p>Your "Hush Pog" is not uninstalled; do this manually,</p> <p>If there's a problem, you can also manually delete the config file. Look for it on this path, and delete it:</p> <pre><code>{FC_PAF} </code></pre> <p><a href="#top">Top</a> {SEP}</p> <p><a name="menus"></a></p> <h1><font color="{heading1}">Menus</font></h1> <ul> <li><strong>Tools menu</strong> <ul> <li><img src="fontypythonmodules/things/icon_settings.png">&nbsp;<strong>Settings:</strong> Access the settings for the font view.

You could do this from the command-line using GNU tools, but any text editor will help you here too.</li> <li>You can backup your Pogs by simply copying them to another folder.</li> <li><p>One last trick, for those proficient with the Gnu tools, you can do things like this:</p> <p>find /home/you/somepath/TTFS/F -iname "Fu*" >> Futura.Pog</p></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p> <p>{SEP}</p> <p><a name="l10n"></a></p> <h1><font color="{heading1}">Localization Tips</font></h1> <p>If localization is not working it could be there is none for your language; it can also be a problem with missing packages in your distro.

Open a console and type: echo $LANG If it reports "C" or "POSIX" or it's blank then you will be running under ANSI (ASCII) encoding only. This means that unusually named fonts and Pogs will likely be invisible to you, function badly, or cause errors. I am putting out fires as fast as I can, but these bugs are hard to find.</p> <p>To see what other encodings you could be using, type:</p> <pre><code> locale -a </code></pre> <p>You should see a list of locales. If you see one ending in "utf8" that looks like it fits your language, then change your system to use it. You should do this via your system-settings gui, but you can do it temporarily like this:</p> <pre><code> LANG=xx_YY.encoding </code></pre> <p>(Where xx_YY and encoding are replaced by you.) After that, start Fonty again.</p> <p>If you want to help translate, please drop us a ticket on: {TICKET_URL}</p> <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p> <p>{SEP}</p> <p><a name="bugs"></a></p> <h1><font color="{heading1}">Bugs</font></h1> <h2><font color="{heading2}"><img src="fontypythonmodules/things/font_segfault.png">&nbsp;Fatal crashes and Dangerous Fonts.</font></h2> <p>Some fonts stick in Fonty's throat and crash her. If you wait a moment, a window should appear and tell you which font is to blame. You should move that font entirely away from where it is. Start Fonty again to resume. </p> <p>If you are stuck, go into your "fontypython" folder and open the file named "lastFontBeforeSegfault", that will be the culprit!</p> <p>To find your fontypython directory, see the <a href="#info">Info</a> section in this help.
