Neither argument is required. When there's only one it's assumed to be a VIEW.

basic_idea = _("""Manage your fonts on GNU/Linux
==============================
Many designers have collections of font files in big directories. Fonty Python
will help you gather these fonts and structure them into collections we'll call
"Pogs" -- a place to keep tyPOGraphy. Well, why not?

Fonty lets you you select fonts visually and put them into Pogs which you can
install or remove as you require.

(Your font files never move from where they are. No copies of your fonts
are made. Only links to them are used.)

For example, you might have a Pog called 'logos' into which you place fonts of
company logos. Thereafter, when you want to use those logos, simply install the
'logos' Pog and start your design app!

When you're done, remove the 'logos' Pog, and the fonts will go away.

Fonty is also great for just looking at fonts, wherever they are, without having 
to install them.""")

Examples: All using short options, see -h
=========
%(c)s /path/to/fonts/ttfs/a
  This will start off showing the fonts in that path.

%(c)s /path/to/fonts/ttfs/b Trouser
  This will let you view and choose fonts from the path and it will store them 
  in a Pog named Trouser. The Pog will be created if it's not already there.

%(c)s Lumberjack
  This will let you see the fonts in the Pog named Lumberjack. You can also 
  uninstall individual fonts by selecting them. A cross will appear indicating 
  the fonts that will be uninstalled.

%(c)s Camelot Spamalot
  This will let you see and choose fonts in Camelot and it will store them 
  in "Spamalot". It lets you copy fonts between Pogs.

%(c)s -i Cheese
  Will install the fonts in Cheese so you can use them in other apps.

%(c)s -u Trouser
  Will uninstall the fonts listed in Trouser.

%(c)s -s 128
  Will set the point size in the gui to 128 - Crazy man!

%(c)s -n 25
  Will show 25 fonts at a time, in the gui. Beware large numbers!

%(c)s -s 64 -v 10 Pimple
  Will set the point size to 64, paging to 10 and display Pimple.

%(c)s -p Glutton
  Purging a font. If there are any fonts in Glutton that are not really on your 
  drive/media anymore (perhaps you deleted them or the cat did) this will go 
  through the Pog and cull them.

%(c)s -c /some/path/to/fonts
  If Fonty keeps crashing on /some/path/to/fonts then you should run a check on
  that folder. This will mark the dangerous fonts and let you view that folder 
  in the future.

%(c)s -a /some/path HolyHandGrenade
  This will put all the fonts in that path into the Pog called HolyHandGrenade.

%(c)s -A /some/path Tutto
  This will do the same as -a: starting in some path, but it will then walk 
  down through *all* sub-folders too. The fonts will be placed in Tutto.
