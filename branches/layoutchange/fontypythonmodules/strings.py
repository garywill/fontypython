Two arguments which will determine what you see in the graphical user interface:
VIEW   : A place where fonts are. A Pog or a folder where fonts are located.
TARGET : A Pog. If this Pog does not exist, it will be created.

Neither argument is required. When there's only one it's assumed to be a VIEW. 
When there are two, it's VIEW then TARGET.

NB: Try not to use spaces in Pog names. If you must, then "quote the name"."""

basic_idea = _("""Manage your fonts on GNU/Linux
==============================
Many designers have collections of font files in big directories. Fonty Python
will help you gather these fonts and structure them into collections we'll call
"Pogs" -- a place to keep tyPOGraphy. Well, why not?

Fonty lets you you select fonts visually and put them into Pogs which you can
install or remove as you require.

(Your font files never move from where they are. No copies of your fonts
are made; only links.)

For example, you might have a Pog called 'logos' into which you place fonts of
company logos. When you want to use those logos, simply install the 'logos' Pog 
and start your design app!

When you're done, remove the 'logos' Pog, and the fonts will go away.

Fonty is also great for just looking at fonts, wherever they are, without having 
to install them.""")

                Uninstall the fonts in this Pog.
  -l, --list
                List the names of all your Pogs.
  -f, --lsfonts

                find the links that Fonty is managing for you.
  -s num, --size=num
                Set a new default point size (you'll see it in the gui).
  -n num, --number=num
                Set a new default for how many fonts to view at one go in the gui.
                (Don't overdo this.)
  -p Pog, --purge=Pog
                Clean the Pog of fonts that are missing.
  -c folder, --check=folder
                Check for bad fonts that crash Fonty. After using this tool you 
                should be able to use Fonty again.
                * NOTE: The fonts that crash Fonty are probably still perfectly
                useable in other apps. 
  -a Folder Pog, --all Folder Pog
                Puts all fonts in Folder into Pog.
  -A Folder Pog, --all-recurse Folder Pog
                Puts all fonts in Folder and *all* sub-folders into Pog.
  -z Pog, --zip=Pog
                All the fonts inside Pog will be zipped and the zipfile will be 
                named after the Pog. The file will be placed in the current
                directory.
  --cat=Pog
                Cat the pog. This will list all the fonts within.
  --hush=HushPog
                Hush *all* the fonts except the ones you have installed.
                Hushing makes font choosers in other apps (like Inkscape)
                much easier to use as they won't be full of random fonts.

                Uses "HushPog", which you create, name and manage, that should 
                contain a few system fonts; in order to supply a basic set 
                to your desktop apps.

                I suggest these from /usr/share/fonts
                (where the '*' means 'whatever'): DejaVu*, Free*, Ubuntu*, 
                Liberation*
  --unhush
                Restores all the system fonts after a hush. Leaves your special
                HushPog installed. It's up to you to manage it.

examples = _("""%(yadda)s

Examples: All using short options, see -h
=========
%(c)s /path/to/fonts/ttfs/a
  This will start off showing the fonts in that path.

%(c)s /path/to/fonts/ttfs/b Trouser
  This will let you view and choose fonts from the path and it will store them 
  in a Pog named Trouser. The Pog will be created if it's not already there.

%(c)s Lumberjack
  This will let you see the fonts in the Pog named Lumberjack. You can also 
  uninstall individual fonts by selecting them. A cross will appear indicating 
  the fonts that will be uninstalled.

%(c)s Camelot Spamalot
  This will let you see and choose fonts in Camelot and it will store them 
  in "Spamalot". It lets you copy fonts between Pogs.

%(c)s -i Cheese
  Will install the fonts in Cheese so you can use them in other apps.

%(c)s -u Trouser
  Will uninstall the fonts listed in Trouser.

%(c)s -s 128
  Will set the point size in the gui to 128 - Crazy man!

%(c)s -n 25
  Will show 25 fonts at a time, in the gui. Beware large numbers!

%(c)s -s 64 -v 10 Pimple
  Will set the point size to 64, paging to 10,open the gui and display the fonts
  in Pimple.

%(c)s -p Glutton
  Purging a font. If there are any fonts in Glutton that are not really on your 
  drive/media anymore (perhaps you deleted them or the cat did) this will go 
  through the Pog and cull them.

%(c)s -c /some/path/to/fonts
  If Fonty keeps crashing on /some/path/to/fonts then you should run a check on
  that folder. This will mark the dangerous fonts and let you view that folder 
  in the future.

%(c)s -a /some/path HolyHandGrenade
  This will put all the fonts in that path into the Pog called HolyHandGrenade.

%(c)s -A /some/path Tutto
  This will do the same as -a: starting in some path, but it will then walk 
  down through *all* sub-folders too. The fonts will be placed in Tutto.

%(c)s --hush mysysfonts
  Will hush (silence) all the fonts in your system except the ones in 
  "mysysfonts" and any other pogs you have installed. Other apps will 
  now have fewer fonts to choose from, making life much easier for you.
  (Use --unhush later to restore all of them.)

Hushing
=======
1. Fontconfig
   Hush relies on fontconfig, which should be installed on most modern Linux desktops.
   You can verify if it's there by trying this command:
   fc-list

   If that shows no error, you're good.

2. Fontconfig's user directory:
   The path is {{fcpaf}}
   Make sure it exists and try fonty again.

3. System fonts: in a Pog that you must create and choose.
   Have a "HushPog", which you create, name and manage, that contains a few
   system fonts; in order to supply a basic set to your desktop apps.

   I suggest these in /usr/share/fonts (where the '*' means 'whatever'): 
   DejaVu*, Free*, Ubuntu*, Liberation*

To hush from the command line do this:
{fp} --hush yourpoghere
