MAKING THE HTML FILES
==
Install markdown (on my sys: apt-get install markdown)

Edit the markdown files.
Run makehtml on each
Move html to wherever.

makehtml
==
Does some replacing - to insert format {tags} into heading tags and stuff. 

Later, python does more replacing to replace those tags with actual system colours and other strings. 
(See the various html panels in gui_dismissbale_panels.py)

distrib script
==
In the root, I have "make_html_and_distrib". This does both help and about and places the files.

Images
==
I am pushing a string into wx.html after loading the html file manually in Python. This causes wx.html to seek paths from the main directory. Hence ref any images as fontypythonmodules/help/common/.. etc.
