MAKING THE HTML FILES
==

Edit the markdown files.
Run makehtml on each
further edit the html if needed
move html into main fs

Images
==
I am pushing a string in wx.html after loading the html file manually in Python. This causes wx.html to seek paths from the main directory. Hence ref any images as fontypythonmodules/help/common/.. etc.
