Thanks
======
Many thanks to:

* Kartik Mistry - Our esteemed Debian packager!
* Robin Dunn - wxPython itself, and much sundry help.
* Martin v. LÃ¶wis - Essential concepts regarding unicode and files.
* Pietro Battiston - Italian translation.
* Michael Hoeft - For code, friendship and the German translation.
* savannah.nongnu.org - For the hosting. You guys rule!
* Michael Moller - For math advice; pointing me in the direction of the 
  "standard-deviation", which I used in the font layout. Also for getting me into 
  Linux all those years ago.
* FichteFoll - For catching a bug which prevented startup when there are no
  pogs! Which is... Ye Gods!
* Akira TAGOH - For help with fontconfig voodoo: rejecting and accepting fonts in the 
  fontconfig XML (on the fontconfig mailing list).
* Jason Yamada-Hanff - For the old wiki.
* Baptiste - French translation and many ideas.

Special thanks to:

* Marie, my mom, who keeps me going. Thanks for supporting me and Fonty!
* Howard, once my dad. He brought computers and code into my world. Died before Linux 
  happened; before the Internet happened. He would have been amazed.
