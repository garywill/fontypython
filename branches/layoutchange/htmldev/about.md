Thanks
======
Primarily to my mother who keeps me going; and to the memory of my dad who brought computers into my world.

Many thanks to:

* **Robin Dunn** - wxPython itself, and much sundry help.
* **Martin v. LÃ¶wis** - Essential concepts regarding unicode and files.
* **Pietro Battiston** - Italian translation.
* **Baptiste** - French translation and many ideas.
* **Jason Yamada-Hanff** - For the old wiki.
* **Michael Hoeft** - For code, friendship and the German translation.
* **Kartik Mistry** - Our esteemed Debian packager!
* **savannah.nongnu.org** - For the hosting. You guys rule!
* **Michael Moller** - For math advice; pointing me in the direction of the "standard-deviation",
  which I used in the font layout. Also for getting me into Linux all those years ago.
