Thanks
======
Many thanks to:
* **Robin Dunn** - wxPython itself, and much sundry help.
* **Martin v. LÃ¶wis** - Essential concepts regarding unicode and files.
* **Pietro Battiston** - Italian translation.
* **Baptiste** - French translation and many ideas.
* **Jason Yamada-Hanff** - For the old wiki.
* **Michael Hoeft** - For code, friendship and the German translation.
* **Kartik Mistry** - Our esteemed Debian packager!
* **savannah.nongnu.org** - For the hosting. You guys rule!
* **Michael Moller** - For math advice; pointing me in the direction of the "standard-deviation",
  which I used in the font layout. Also for getting me into Linux all those years ago.
* **FichteFoll** - For catching a bug which prevented startup when there are no pogs! Which is... Ye Gods!
* **Akira TAGOH** - For help with fontconfig voodoo: rejecting and accepting fonts in the 
  fontconfig XML (on the fontconfig mailing list).

Special thanks to:
* Marie (my mother) who keeps me going every day. Thanks for supporting me and Fonty!
* Howard (my dad), in memory. He brought computers and code into my world. He died before Linux happened,
  before the Internet happened. He would have been amazed.
