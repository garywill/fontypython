Clean slate:
 rm -fr ~/.fonts; rm -fr ~/.fontypython; rm ~/.local/share/fonts; rm -fr ~/.local/share/fontypython

Run her:
 ./fontypython
No config file found, creating it with defaults.

(Good)
App opens in a small window.
Note: Info font message is not wrapping
Note: Hush Pog para still clipping height. Last line missing.


1. No .fonts or .fontypython in ~ (Good)
2. There is fonts and fontypython in ~/.local/share (Good)
3. fontypython contains: fp.conf and overlap_counts (Good)


I made a Pog called 'zog'
I browsed to a folder. Recursion was OFF by default. (Good)
I put a font into it.
Installed zog (checked ls ~/.local/share/fonts) it's there
Uninstalled; it's gone.
(Good)



Old FP -> New FP upgrade process:
-----
I have a script that makes the old fonty paths and rms the new ones.
(i.e. reset to old FP)

donn@ddm:~/.../branches/layoutchange$ cat reset_to_old_system 
## A way to restore to old system so I can hack-test the pathcontrol code
echo Cleaning XDG shit
rm -fr ~/.local/share/fontypython
rm ~/.local/share/fonts/*.*

echo Making dot fp
rm -fr ~/.fontypython
mkdir ~/.fontypython
tar xzhf homedotfontypython_backup.tgz -C ~
echo ".fontypython restored"

echo Making dot fonts
rm -fr ~/.fonts
mkdir ~/.fonts
tar xzhf homedotfonts_backup.tgz -C ~
echo ".fonts restored"

I ran it.

Now to run fonty:
./fontypython
1. No output at all (Good?)
2. No errors! (Good)

1. ~/.fontypython <-- no such dir (Good)
2. ~/.fonts is still there, but all links within are gone (Good)
3. ~/.local/share/fonts exists - the links are all in there. (Good)
4. ~/.local/share/fontypython exists - the pogs etc. are all there (Good)



Testing how it handles path errors.
----------------------------------
This is harder to do. I must hack bad file/group permissions or something. at the moment
I am doing this by altering variables in the code - to /root/blah - to force these kinds
of errors.

TIP: Search for ##TEST in gvim.

** Test 1: Emulate not being able to find/create the DATA_HOME dir
(~/.local/share)

 XDG_DATA_HOME = ""
 At the top, so it would override the proper value.

Run:
1. Reports no config file found. (Good)
2. ~/.fontypython appears with defaults (Good)
Verdict - It properly falls-back.


** Test 2: Remark that test and run it again. It should detect the 
old .fontypython and upgrade her:
Run:
1. ~/.fontypython is gone (Good)
2. ~/.local/share/fontypython seems good to go (Good?)
   (I did not think to delete it too, before test 2.)


** Test 3: Repeat Test 1, then rm -fr ~/.local/share/fontypython, then 
        repeat test 2:
Test 1, same
Test 2, ~/.local/share/fontypython was made. Default contents. (Good)


** Test 4: fontconfig
I will set a bad path just before the app looks for it:
   fcp="/root/fontfoo"
Run:
* I get appropriate warnings in the hush screen. (Good)
* Also get an error on the cli (Good)


** Test 5: NoFontypythonDir test
Set a var to force a fail when app seeks the ~/.local/share/fontypython dir.
  self.__try_test_make_dir("/root/bar", "NoFontypythonDir")
Run:
* I get a msgbox with a fatal error and some advice. (Good)
* cli: Also. (Good)


** Test 6: NoFontsDir test
Set a var to force fail on seek of ~/.local/share/fonts dir
  self.__try_test_make_dir("/root/foo", "NoFontsDir")
Run:
* gui: No overt error. Status bar message.
NOTE: It's crowded and cut-off. :(
* cli: Error message, but non fatal (Good)


** Test 7: Leaving test 6 active: try to install a Pog
Run:
* gui: It gives an error in a msgbox. (Good)
* cli: The error is printed twice, but it "works". (Good)


** Test 8: force segfault: 
Found a bug. Bad import-loop via fpwx module. Think it's fixed
* gui (Good)
* cli: The crash is show via wx dialogue. Ha. Ah well. (Good enough)


** Test 9: Run app with and without Pogs installed.
* gui: Empty list controls. No errors. (Good)
* cli: Complains properly. (Good)
