Changelist
==========
11 June 2009
1. Changed many button events to wx.EVT_BUTTON for better behaviour )
2. Fixed Bug 2 (wxgui) -- The Tab->Folder->Last Directory->Show Fonts bug.
3. Changed cli, fontcontrol, strings and wxgui to allow recursive folders. 

12 June 2009
1. Adding a Search Assistant panel. It's full of junk from the wxDemo at the moment.
2. Added/Edited ROADMAP after reading email from Michael.
3. Removed Select All button. RIP bad idea :)
4. Added Selection menu and it's sub-items. Wired-them up to the remains of the Select Button code.
5. Fixed the PogChooser issue betwixt source and target. 
6. Split-off most of wxgui.py classes into their own gui_xxx.py modules. 
   Trying to make it simpler. We now have gui_Left, gui_Middle and gui_Right for the main sections.

13 June 2009
1. Continued the refactoring. Moved functions to where they made more sense. Cut down on chains of calls.
2. Got rid of shadow functions. At last!
3. Put refs to locale stuff into the new modules, BUT HAVE NOT TESTED i18n yet. HELP!
4. Improved the pubsub a tiny little bit. Also removed the return value -- it was not being used.
5. Fixed strings GPL message. It loads it from the COPYING file.
6. Hacking a search bar together from a combo box and some spare bits :)

14 June
1. Got the search combo box working a little. History is added etc.

16 June
1. Fixed the bug where the first fitmap in the fontview would draw at an odd y value.
2. Fixed the persistent InfoFontItem issue. Now it goes away when it should.

18 June
1. Many visual fixes. Re-factored the drawing code in Fitmap.
2. Many little fixes like toggle selection menu and multi-selection on/off in the lists.

19 June
1. Gave up on the fancy search dream. FontTools and Panose confuse me horribly. 
   Michael can't help dev at the moment, so it's all back to square one.
   I remarked-out the assistant panel.
2. I got the left and right arrow keys to step through the list - like the buttons do.
3. I (think I) fixed the ESC key to work from anywhere.

20 June
1. Cleaning-up files etc. Lot's of little zipzap commits. Yesterday I merged the branch
   back into the trunk.
2. Caught an encode and decode problem in Folder.__init__. Had to jump through the usual
   unicode hoops to fix it. Hope it is fixed now...
3. Added the licence header to a bunch of files it was missing from.
4. Small fixes to README regarding i18n.
5. Fixing some unicode errors and error dialog boxes.
6. Trying to repair the "lost focus" bug when the main button is clicked -- so far no dice.

22 June
1. Rigged the main button so that focus is not lost on click. It's a hack, but what the heck.
