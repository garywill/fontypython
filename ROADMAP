ROADMAP
=======

NOTE 1
In order to move ahead we need to stick to a single conceptual framework and 
I think the one to use is:
  "Make and show font items and fitmaps *only* in pages of X items."
This is a conservative approach. It assumes few resources are available to
run Fonty. It tries to prioritize speed of start-up and lightness of footprint.


wxgui Bugs
==========
Bug 1
> #2 If you want change to the "Pog"-page in the left source notebook after
> a folder was selected in the "Folder"-dircontrol, two clicks are
> needed. The first only takes the focus from the dircontrol, the second
> selects the "Pog"-page.
> Replace the standard wx.Notebook with wx.aui.AuiNotebook helps.
>> Yes, AuiNotebook really fix this bug. But, I see, this is problematic,
>> AUI has an other look, that doesn't fits to the rest. I think there is
>> a way to fix this bug with the old notebook, deep in the code there
>> must lack an event.Skip(). One function has to be overwritten, but
>> don't ask me which and where.
Best fix : Keep old notebook control and have it function properly. 
Next best: Replace with aui notebook.



wxgui Tasks
===========
A) Search
We need a panel that appears above the controls and below (or over, like a 
div on a web page) the font list (in the middle column). It should (ideally)
slide (animate) up and down. 
However it appears, the idea is that it will be extra room for help with searching.
It may also house the PANOSE wizard. (see later in this doc.)

Within the panel - draw the search fields (see Search Module) in some way. 
If any one is clicked on then it should appear (at the cursor) in the search bar.

We need a search bar that:
 * Keeps history.
 * Offers a way to move fwd/back in history (i.e. can access history)
 * Is clearable.
 * Has a "Search" button.
 * Has an "Assist" button. (Opens the panel above)

B) Pager
If possible, replace the combo-box for paging with a more web-like 
pager control: << < 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 > >> 

Keep the Next and Previous buttons and bind keystrokes to them.

C) Selection menu
Select All, Clear all selected

D) Font view selection
Ctrl+a for select-all (visible in page)
shift+click for range selection

E) Remove the Select All button

D) Improve the errorText() messages. Use Michael's code.

Search Module
=============
A) Parser
1. Ensure that we have a search "language" and that it parses the search string
into the proper tokens. Decide on the names of the fields for searching. Example Copyright:
and PANOSE:
* I would suggest we make the field names case insensitive!

2. Ensure that this works with i18n/unicode. This is going to be difficult. At the minimum we 
need to test on English/German but French and Italian would be good too.

3. Ensure that if we cannot do 2, that the search does not crash or block the use of
Fonty. We should still be able to "search" on simple fields like "bold" and "Italic" and, 
most importantly, a blank search should mean "All".

B) Search
1. Given a list fields:values and a list of fontitems, go through each and supply those that 
match the search criteria.
The search should be "loose" i.e. not too strict. Rather include than exclude.
The search terms are automatically "AND". I vote there is no "OR" and no "NOT".

2. Make sure this works with i18n and unicode... At minimum there should be no crashes, no
decode errors. The app should ignore and continue on any problems.

Mad Ideas
=========
PANOSE WIZARD
My understanding of Panose is very basic. I could not find proper info online. I read
what I could. 

Given that Panose is some kind of encoding of a Font's attributes and that
some of those are its appearance -- it should be possible to construct a Panose number
from a series of visuals. For example:
(picture of a serif letter)[radio button]
(picture of a sans letter)[radio button]
Next>>
(picture of a western letter)[radio button]
(picture of a non-western letter)[radio button]
Next>>
{Latin fork in road}
(picture of a curved serif)[radio button]
(picture of a block serif)[radio button]
Next>>
And so on... until the entire set of Panose choices has been run and we can present
a Panose number for them.

Could this be done? If so, it should happen in the panel above the search bar.
It should also have a history and a means to enter the wizard at arbitrary points of the 
chain. It should be obvious, easy and quick.
